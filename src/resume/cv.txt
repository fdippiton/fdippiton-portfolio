Dear <recruiter>:


My name is Francina Dippiton and I am from the Dominican Republic. I am a student of Computer Systems Engineering at UNPHU.   I enjoy technology and all the process of developing and building software. So I’m so excited to start contributing to this amazing field of science. I like programming, being able to innovate, and create helpful technology to bring value to society. I like how complex software can get, and how it allows us to abstract aspects from our real world to bring them to the virtual field. I like how amazing that is. 


After doing some research on different platforms, I found the position of <position name> posted in this company, so I decided to apply to it because I consider that I can fit in that position and contribute in a good way to the development of your company. You are looking for a person with skills on <stack technologies> and I match with most of them. I am always willing to improve and be able to gain the knowledge and skills required. I am open to grow and become a better developer and person.


I definitely think this company is a great place to continue developing my software skills. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.




Sincerely,


Francina Dippitón
